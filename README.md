# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Projects and tasks done on sorting algorithms and Big O notation are contained in this repository.
Sorting algorithm covered (attached are links which further helped me to understand the concepts of respective sorts) include:
* Bubble Sorts
* Insertion Sorts
* Selection Sorts
* Quick Sorts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COk73cpQbFQ)
* Merge Sorts
* Shell sort (www.youtube.com/watch?v=9crZRd8GPWMlse)
* Cocktail shaker sort
* Counting Sorts
* Heap sort etc.

Each of the sort implemented in this task is has its big O analysis file indicated by the corresponding number of the task followed by O. e.g. 0-O, 1-O, 2-O
